# üîß GoDaddy DNS Configuration for GitHub Pages

## Common GoDaddy DNS Issues & Solutions

### üö® "Invalid DNS" Error Solutions:

#### **Issue 1: GoDaddy DNS Format**
GoDaddy uses slightly different terminology:

**Instead of "@ (or betyard.net)" use:**
- **Type**: A Record
- **Host**: @ 
- **Points to**: [IP Address]
- **TTL**: 1 Hour (or 3600 seconds)

#### **Issue 2: Remove Existing Records First**
GoDaddy often has default records that conflict:
1. **Delete** any existing A records pointing to GoDaddy parking
2. **Delete** any CNAME records for @ (root domain)
3. **Then** add the GitHub Pages records

### üéØ **Correct GoDaddy DNS Settings:**

#### **A Records (Add these 4):**
```
Type: A Record
Host: @
Points to: 185.199.108.153
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: A Record  
Host: @
Points to: 185.199.109.153
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: A Record
Host: @  
Points to: 185.199.110.153
TTL: 1 Hour

Type: A Record
Host: @
Points to: 185.199.111.153  
TTL: 1 Hour
```

#### **CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Points to: david-osb.github.io
TTL: 1 Hour
```

### üîç **Step-by-Step GoDaddy Fix:**

#### **1. Access GoDaddy DNS:**
- Login to GoDaddy account
- Go to "My Products" ‚Üí "All Products and Services"
- Find your "betyard.net" domain
- Click "DNS" or "Manage DNS"

#### **2. Clean Existing Records:**
- Look for any A records with "@" host
- **DELETE** records pointing to:
  - Parked domain IPs (usually 184.168.x.x)
  - GoDaddy default parking
  - Any conflicting A records

#### **3. Add GitHub Pages Records:**
- Click "Add Record" or "+"
- Select "A" type
- Host: @ (just the @ symbol)
- Points to: 185.199.108.153
- Save and repeat for other 3 IPs

#### **4. Add CNAME:**
- Add Record ‚Üí CNAME
- Host: www
- Points to: david-osb.github.io
- Save

### üö® **Common GoDaddy Mistakes:**

#### **‚ùå Wrong Format:**
- Using "betyard.net" instead of "@"
- Including "https://" in the IP address
- Missing the www CNAME record

#### **‚úÖ Correct Format:**
- Host field: exactly "@" (no quotes)
- IP addresses: just the numbers, no protocol
- TTL: 1 Hour or 3600

### üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative: Use GoDaddy Forwarding**

If DNS keeps failing, use GoDaddy's domain forwarding:

#### **Domain Forwarding Setup:**
1. In GoDaddy Domain settings
2. Look for "Forwarding" section  
3. Forward betyard.net ‚Üí https://david-osb.github.io
4. Forward www.betyard.net ‚Üí https://david-osb.github.io
5. Enable "Forward with masking" to keep betyard.net in URL

### üîÑ **Troubleshooting Commands:**

Check if DNS is working:
```bash
nslookup betyard.net
dig betyard.net
```

Should return GitHub's IP addresses.

### üìû **GoDaddy Support Script:**
If still having issues, call GoDaddy support and say:

*"I need to point my domain betyard.net to GitHub Pages. I need to add 4 A records with @ host pointing to GitHub's IPs: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, and 185.199.111.153. I also need a CNAME record for www pointing to david-osb.github.io. The DNS manager is showing invalid errors."*

### ‚ö° **Quick Alternative: Cloudflare**
If GoDaddy DNS keeps causing issues:
1. Keep domain at GoDaddy
2. Change nameservers to Cloudflare (free)
3. Manage DNS through Cloudflare (much easier)
4. Add GitHub Pages records in Cloudflare
