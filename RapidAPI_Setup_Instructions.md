# üèà NFL Quarterback Roster API Setup Instructions

## Overview
Your NFL QB Predictor now includes integration with RapidAPI's NFL API Data service to fetch real-time quarterback and backup quarterback roster information for all NFL teams.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your RapidAPI Key
1. Go to [RapidAPI NFL API Data](https://rapidapi.com/Creativesdev/api/nfl-api-data)
2. Sign up for a free RapidAPI account (if you don't have one)
3. Subscribe to the NFL API Data service (free tier available)
4. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure the API Key
1. Open `UI.roughdraft2.html` in your code editor
2. Find line with: `const RAPIDAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE';`
3. Replace `YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE` with your actual RapidAPI key
4. Save the file

### 3. Features Available

#### Automatic Data Loading
- On page load, the system will automatically try to fetch live QB roster data
- Priority order: RapidAPI ‚Üí ScrapeOwl ‚Üí Emergency cached data

#### Manual Data Refresh
- Click the **üèà Fetch QB Roster Data** button to manually refresh quarterback data
- This will fetch the latest roster information for all NFL teams

#### Data Includes
- **Starting quarterbacks** for all 32 NFL teams
- **Backup quarterbacks** where available
- Player information: name, position, jersey number, height, weight, age, college
- Current season stats projections

### 4. API Endpoints Used
The system uses the following RapidAPI endpoints:
- **Team Roster**: `GET /nfl-team-roster/{teamId}` - Gets complete roster for specific team
- **Rate Limiting**: 500ms delays between requests to respect API limits

### 5. Error Handling
If RapidAPI fails:
1. System falls back to ScrapeOwl web scraping
