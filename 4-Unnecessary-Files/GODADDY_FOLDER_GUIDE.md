# 🔍 GoDaddy File Manager Navigation Guide

## Step-by-Step: Finding Your Website Folder

### 🌐 Login to GoDaddy:
1. Go to https://godaddy.com
2. Click "Sign In" (top right)
3. Enter your login credentials
4. Go to "My Products"

### 📁 Access File Manager:
1. Find your hosting account for "betyard.net"
2. Click "Manage" next to your hosting
3. Look for one of these options:
   - **cPanel** (most common)
   - **File Manager** 
   - **Website Files**
   - **FTP & Files**

### 🎯 Find Your Website Root:
Once in File Manager, look for these folders (in order of likelihood):

#### ✅ Most Likely Folders:
1. **public_html** ← Try this first
2. **www** ← Second most common
3. **htdocs** ← Some shared hosting
4. **html** ← Alternative name
5. **betyard.net** ← Domain-specific folder

#### 🔍 How to Identify the Correct Folder:
The correct folder will either:
- Be empty (new hosting account)
- Contain a "coming soon" page
- Have an existing index.html file
- Show a file size/modification date

### 🚨 Can't Find Any of These Folders?

#### Check Your Hosting Type:
**WordPress Hosting:**
- Look for `wp-content` folder
- Your files might go in a different location
- May need WordPress setup first

**Website Builder Hosting:**
- GoDaddy's website builder doesn't use file upload
- You'd need to switch to traditional hosting

#### 📞 Contact GoDaddy Support:
If you still can't find the right folder:
- **Phone**: 1-480-505-8877
- **Live Chat**: In your GoDaddy account dashboard
- **Question to ask**: "Where do I upload HTML files for my betyard.net domain?"

### 💡 Alternative: Check Your Hosting Plan

#### In Your GoDaddy Account:
1. Go to "My Products" → "Web Hosting"
2. Look at your hosting plan details
3. Check if you have:
   - **Shared Hosting** (uses public_html)
   - **WordPress Hosting** (different setup)
   - **Website Builder** (no file upload)

### 🚀 Quick Test Method:
1. Create a simple test file: `test.html`
2. Put just this content: `<h1>Test Page</h1>`
3. Upload to the folder you think is correct
4. Visit: `https://betyard.net/test.html`
5. If it shows, you found the right folder!

### 📋 What to Do Once You Find It:
1. **Delete** any existing files (coming soon pages, etc.)
2. **Upload** your files from `godaddy-upload` folder:
   - index.html
   - nfl-qb-predictor.html
   - robots.txt
   - sitemap.xml
3. **Test** by visiting https://betyard.net
